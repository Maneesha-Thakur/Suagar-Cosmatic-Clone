      <Text>No grudge against eyeliners or lipsticks, but the foundation is the backbone of makeup. Be it a casual office look or Met Gala appearance, you need a long-lasting foundation to level up your game. The gem might look easier to apply and simpler to flaunt, but most people (even professionals) make trivial mistakes that ruin their entire makeup. Being a base to your glamorous look, the foundation has to be on point and be faultless. To compete with a fresh and smooth celebrity look, you have to try these foundation hacks for long-wear makeup, which will definitely amp up your game.



#Hack 1: Prep up for flawless skin: Although there is nothing like a no-makeup look, the art of flawless, natural-looking makeup comes from deep hydrating skincare. The nourished, soft skin with the help of SUGAR Aquaholic Hydrating Stick prevents your foundation from going cakey. Follow the process Exfoliate →Moisturize →Prime. The trio combo will give you a faultless base and make your makeup last all day long.



#Hack 2: Foundation + Facial Oil for dewy skin: Do not we all want that illuminating Korean skin? Well, this foundation hack can take you one step closer to that. Mix a few drops of lightweight facial oil with SUGAR Rage For Coverage 24Hr Foundation to get luminous, dewy skin. This hack involves less foundation and will make your makeup last all day long.




#Hack 3: Layer up lightly: There is nothing chicer than a lightweight foundation. This foundation hack for long wear makeup gives you non-cakey, fresh looking skin. Apply the formula to areas that need it the most. Start from the center and then blend it towards other directions. The T-zone is prone to redness and therefore requires more coverage. Use the second coat only if needed.



#Hack 4: Customize with two foundation shades: Even if you are a home bunny, your face would definitely have different shades. A minute in the sun can make your skin tan. Your forehead would be a darker shade than your chin. In this case, you may need two different shades of long-lasting foundation for a natural finish. Try SUGAR Ace Of Face Foundation Stick is a lightweight formula with many shades matching your skin tone.



#Hack 5: Concealer after foundation: The entire coverage foundation tends to cover most problematic areas, so use concealer only to places that need extra coverage. Concealers are usually heavier than foundations, so they might look masked and heavy if you layer both on your skin. Do spot treatment with SUGAR Magic Wand Waterproof Concealer as it comes with a flat tip applicator to target vital areas.



#Hack 6: Damp your foundation brush: If you want a flawless and natural-looking base, try this foundation hack. Spritz the setting spray on your SUGAR Blend Trend Foundation Brush and stipple the foundation. This will keep your makeup glued to the face and give you a lightweight airbrush look.



#Hack 7: Swipe your stippling makeup brush downwards: Many professionals follow the downward stroke brush technique. While applying the foundation, make sure to move your brush downward as it covers the pores rather than filling it up. This coverage fades the apparent pores and also helps with fuzzy facial hair.



#Hack 8: Use setting powder before foundation: This intriguing hack for a long-lasting foundation is worth trying. Change your makeup regime and use the SUGAR All Set To Go Translucent Powder all over your face before using a liquid foundation. This lightweight mattifying powder is perfect for oily skin as it soaks up all the greasiness and gives you a matte look. For dry skin, avoid using powder all over the face. Focus on the T-zone or other oily areas.



#Hack 9: Work in bright light: Last but the most essential foundation hack is doing your makeup in bright light. This would give you a clear visual of whether you need more foundation or not, plus it will save you from the embarrassment if makeup drastically appears different in bright light.
