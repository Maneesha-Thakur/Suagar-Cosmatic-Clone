      <Text>Cakey faces during summers are a big nah. The advent of skinimalistic makeup trends especially during this time of the year seem like a saving base, oops we mean a saving grace! A tragic melting face, courtesy, heavy layers of foundation, can be avoided if you skip your foundation for good. You have probably heard this for a zillion times but please pay attention to it for once â€“ slathering foundation on your face during summers in the midst of scorching heat and constant sweating is the perfect recipe for a makeup disaster! Listen to the pros and pick up a BB cream for your face, this summer!</Text>
